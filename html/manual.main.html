<h1> Manual for the Web Lua REPL </h1>
<p>
  This web app has a few caveats to its use that normal Lua
  does not suffer. For the Lua documentation, please view
  <a href="../doc/readme.html">
    the Lua Read Me (Cached).

<ol>
  <li>
    Files only persist if written to the <code>/idbfs/</code> folder.
  </li>
  <li>
    Changes to persistent files are only written
    from the Lua REPL if you
    press the <code>Persist File Changes</code> button.
  </li>
  <li>
    dynamic library calls currently do not work, although
    it is possible to eventually support such things
    by allowing <code>.wasm</code> and <code>.js</code>
    files to be uploaded.
