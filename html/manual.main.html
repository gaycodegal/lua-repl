  <li>
    Files only persist if written to the <code>/idbfs/</code> folder.
  </li>
  <li>
    Changes to persistent files are also attempted to be written
    when the REPL page is closed. You can also manually
    press the <code>Persist File Changes</code> button
    to trigger this.

  <li>
    dynamic library calls currently do not work, although
    it is possible to eventually support such things
    by allowing <code>.wasm</code> and <code>.js</code>
    files to be uploaded.
